You will:
+ Use a potentiometer (dial) to change the heart rate
+ Create a pulsing effect with an LED
+ Power your Raspberry Pi Pico away from your computer

An <span style="color: #0faeb0">analogue input</span> gives a range of values, rather than just a 0 or 1 (on or off). A <span style="color: #0faeb0">potentiometer</span> is an analogue input component that has a dial that you turn to increase or decrease values. The Raspberry Pi Pico has analogue input pins that allow you to read analogue values and use them in your code.

To complete this project you will need:

**Hardware**

You can purchase all the required hardware for this project and the other projects in this path from the [Pimoroni web store.](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-intro-kit?variant=39893512945747){:target='_blank'}

+ A Raspberry Pi Pico with pin headers soldered on
+ A **data** USB A to micro USB cable
+ 1× yellow LED (or any colour you prefer)
+ 1× 100Ω resistor (any resistor from 75Ω to 220Ω will work)
+ 1× pin–socket jumper wire
+ 3× socket–socket jumper wire You can purchase all the compone
+ Optional: Sticky tape, invisible tape works best

[[[pin-socket-jumper-wires]]]

You can [prepare your LED](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/introduction-to-the-pico){:target="_blank"} in advance by attaching it to a resistor and jumper wires before starting the project.

**Software**

+ Thonny – this project can be completed using the Thonny Python editor, which can be installed on a Linux, Windows, or Mac computer

Look at the video of the heartbeat being controlled by a potentiometer. What happens as the dial is turned left and right?
