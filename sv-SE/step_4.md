Or cut two, and tape them together: ![Image showing two identical red paper hearts cut out of paper.](images/heart-cutout2.png)

Step 1: Start with a square piece of paper. (Any paper will do, but thinner paper will make your LED brighter.) ![Image showing a red square of paper.](images/heart1.png)


Step 2: Fold the paper in half by folding the top corner to the bottom corner, then unfold. ![Image showing the square of paper folded corner to corner in a triangle.](images/heart2.png)

Step 4: Fold the top corner to the center of the square, to make a 'shield' shape. ![Image showing the square of paper with top corner folded to the centre to create a pentagon.](images/heart6.png)


Step 5: Fold the bottom corner up to meet the top edge, overlapping the previous fold. ![Image showing the square of paper with the bottom corner folded so it touches the top edge.](images/heart7.png)

Step 6: Fold the bottom left and right ends up at a 90 degree angle, so that their lower edges run along the centre crease. ![Image showing the paper square folded into a chevron shape from the back.](images/heart8.png)

Step 7: Fold the top and side corners back. ![Image showing the paper square folded into a heart shape from the back, with both top and side corners folded up.](images/heart10.png)

Step 8: Tape the back side of the heart across the widest part, from edge to edge. ![Image showing the paper square folded into a heart shape from the back, with tape holding it together.](images/heart11.png)

Turn it over to look at the front, and you're ready to embed your LED! ![Image showing the finished origami heart.](images/heart.png)
