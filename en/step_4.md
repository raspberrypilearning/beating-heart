Or cut two, and tape them together:

Step 1: Start with a square piece of paper. (Any paper will do, but thinner paper will make your LED brighter.)

Step 2: Fold the paper in half by folding the top corner to the bottom corner, then unfold.

Step 4: Fold the top corner to the center of the square, to make a 'shield' shape.

Step 5: Fold the bottom corner up to meet the top edge, overlapping the previous fold.

Step 6: Fold the bottom left and right ends up at a 90 degree angle, so that their lower edges run along the center crease.

Step 7: Fold the top and side corners back.

Step 8: Tape the back side of the heart across the widest part, from edge to edge.

Turn it over to look at the front, and you're ready to embed your LED!
