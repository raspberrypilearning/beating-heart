An <span style="color: #0faeb0">analogue input</span> gives a range of values, rather than just a 0 or 1 (on off). A <span style="color: #0faeb0">potentiometer</span> is an analogue input component that has a dial that you turn to increase or decrease values. The Raspberry Pi Pico has analogue input pins that allow you to read analogue values and use them in your code.</p>
