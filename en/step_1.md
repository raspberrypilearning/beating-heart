## Introduction

Make a papercraft beating heart with an LED that blinks like a heartbeat. Make a button to turn the heart on and off and control the heart rate. 

![Completed project](images/showcase_static.png)

You will:
+ Understand what a **microcontroller** is and use one to make an **embedded** device
+ Connect **electronics components** to the **pins** on the **Raspberry Pi Pico**
+ Program the **Pico** to interact with **electronics components** using **micropython** and [Thonny](http://thonny.org){:target="_blank"}
