You will:
+ Use a potentiometer (dial) to change the heart rate
+ Create a pulsing effect with an LED
+ Power your Raspberry Pi Pico away from your computer

An <span style="color: #0faeb0">analogue input</span> gives a range of values, rather than just a 0 or 1 (on or off). A <span style="color: #0faeb0">potentiometer</span> is an analogue input component that has a dial that you turn to increase or decrease values. The Raspberry Pi Pico has analogue input pins that allow you to read analogue values and use them in your code.

Look at the video of the heartbeat being controlled by a potentiometer. What happens as the dial is turned left and right?
