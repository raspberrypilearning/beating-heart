You will:
+ Create a pulsing effect with an LED
+ Use a potentiometer (dial) to change the heart rate 
+ Power your Raspberry Pi Pico away from your computer

An <span style="color: #0faeb0">analogue input</span> gives a range of values, rather than just a 0 or 1 (on off). A <span style="color: #0faeb0">potentiometer</span> is an analogue input component that has a dial that you turn to increase or decrease values. The Raspberry Pi Pico has analogue input pins that allow you to read analogue values and use them in your code.

To complete any of the projects in the [Introduction to the Raspberry Pi Pico](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/pico-intro){:target="_blank"} path, you will need:

Hardware:
+ A Raspberry Pi Pico with pin headers soldered on
+ A data USB A to micro USB cable

Software:
+ [Thonny](http://thonny.org){:target="_blank"} Python editor installed on a personal computer with USB port

In addition, to complete this Beating heart project, you will need:
+ One red LED with a resistor attached to jumper wires with a socket connector
+ One sheet of paper, red if you have it
+ Kitchen foil 
+ Sticky tape or duct tape
+ 2 x pin-socket jumper wires
+ Optionally, a blue LED, resistor and more jumper wires

Look at the video of the heart beat being controlled by a potentiometer. What happens as the dial is turned left and right?
