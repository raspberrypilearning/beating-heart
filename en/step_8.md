## Upgrade your project

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
If you have time, you can upgrade your beating heart project. 

You can use your portable beating heart as a room decoration. Set it to a slow speed to help you relax. Or, adjust the beat to match the music you are listening to.
